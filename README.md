# Football Team Random Assignment (Python OOP Project)

## 📌 Overview
This project demonstrates **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** concepts in Python through a simple football team assignment system.  
We create 22 football players, each as an object of the `Footballer` class, which inherits from a parent class `Human`.  
Using the `random` module, players are randomly distributed between two teams: **Team A** and **Team B**.

## 🧱 Features
- Implementation of OOP concepts:
  - Class creation
  - Inheritance
  - Object instantiation
- Random player distribution using `random.shuffle`
- Clean and readable structure for easy understanding
- Easy to extend (adding position, number, speed, etc.)
